### More projects coming soon!

In the mean time, I have some previous CAD or model building projects.

<br>

#### What

This is my senior design/capstone project. I made the CAD design in SolidWorks based on team input. We had to design a robot arm that could reach an objective at the end of a "2' cube complex array" (box filled with obstacles). This was the design we came up with; It is a repeating module with two degrees of freedom in each joint. It is modular be design so that modules can be subtracted if necessary and connect to other types of parts.

<br>

#### How 

We initialized and justified a design which was refined throughout the course. Once we had some essential features, it was possible to work within those parameters to come up with the design here.

<br>

#### What

In another team, we developed an ASTM based test protocol for measuring solid thermal insulation using $100 of equipment or less. We had to show our design in CAD so I made the hotplate as part of that assembly.

<br>

#### How 

We researched a standard to make a derivative test and after feedback from our TA and professor, we finalized our test method.

<br>

#### What

This is a model reactor I built of the Breazeale Nuclear Reactor. It is not a scale model, but an impression. It is based off of [these images](http://pabook2.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/Breazeale.html).

<br>

#### How 

The first image is the "dry" reactor assembly, unpainted 3D prints assembled with a blue LED to represent [Cherenkov Radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation#:~:text=Cherenkov%20radiation%20(%2Ft%CA%83%C9%99%CB%88,in%20a%20medium)%20of%20light).

The second image is after it had been spray painted a metalic grey and cast into blue-dyed epoxy in an old vase. This was my only time working with epoxy and I failed to realize just how much gas is produced. Thus, there are a few bubbles remaining. Not shown here, but after bathing the vase in hot water, I was able to at least let the mix consolidate into a few larger bubbles.
