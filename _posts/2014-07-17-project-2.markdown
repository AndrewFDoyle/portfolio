### Goal - *Learn the Landscape of Data Analysis*

<br>
The Google Data Analytics Certificate (GDAC) provided me with the framework to learn data analysis and analytics. It is clear that the courses were made by practitioners who added resources and material into the courses that they themselves would have found helpful when starting their careers. Here are a few comments on the tools and skills learned below.
<br>

#### Excel and Google Sheets

Prior to this series, Google sheets was not something I knew very well. I would typically use an Excel spreadsheet for the task and although they are largely similar, each of them has natural strengths. I learned both in greater detail for cleaning and analyzing data.

Simultaneously, when I started the LIDS project, I began learning VBA Macros to modify my pantry inventory. Later, this was all changed to python code for reasons of compatabillity with the Raspberry Pi which was a later addition.

#### BigQuery and SQL

My introduction to SQL came through GDAC using Google's BigQuery. This gave me a solid foundation to move to MySQL/MariaDB when I made the LAMP stack server for the LIDS project.

#### Tableau

Tableau is a neat tool. Once I got to follow along with the GDAC examples, I really started liking the program and learning more about what it is capable of doing. Since then, I have started a project to build an interactive dashboard to track game popularity that is now in the works.

#### R Langauge

GDAC built my foundation in R in the seventh course of the series and it laid the ground work for me to continue coding for analysis afterwards. I have been mostly using python, but I would be glad to pick R up again and go deeper on it.
